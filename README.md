### about me
i'm beverly. i enjoy the balance of technical troubleshooting and creative expression. i’m driven by a passion for making things work better through automation and making things look better through code.

outside of tech, my world is very tactile:
* capturing moments through a lens
* the slow art of embroidery 
* traditional sketching on paper

### focus
right now, i'm exploring the stability of **linux** and the efficiency of **no-code automation**. while i don't have a live project at this moment, i'm spending my time refining my current stack and learning new systems.
